== Reflection

=== Why I chose the instructions brochure

This assignment was the kind of task that I particularly enjoy doing as I like clarifying information and making it easier to read and understand by the consumer.

=== Which skills were demonstrated

The skills demonstrated were:

Improving the language to first language speaker standard.

Restructuring the information in a logical flow, and distinct sections, in compliance with safety standards i.e., including the necessary warnings and cautions, troubleshooting help, contact information, etc.

Finding and adding missing information and graphics

Creating a more visually appealing layout

Adding a table of contents and an index

Adding a glossary

Adding a QR code for easy access to the website

Adding a feedback form

#Adding a section for the user to write notes

=== What I learnt from improving the instructions brochure

#Attention to detail, and the importance of clear and concise language, and the need to make the information easy to find and understand.#

##The original instruction sheet did not adhere to many of the "rules" of good technical communication as laid out by Gurak and Lannon (2007) and Markel & Selber (2021). Markel & Selber describe Technical Communication as having six characteristics:

Addresses particular readers

Helps readers solve problems

Reflects an organization's goals and culture

Is produced collaboratively

Uses design to increase readability, and

Consists of words or graphics or both.##
