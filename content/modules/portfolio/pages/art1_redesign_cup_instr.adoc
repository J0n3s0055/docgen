== Reflection

=== Why I chose the instructions brochure

This assignment was the kind of task that I particularly enjoy doing as I like clarifying information and making it easier for the consumer to read and understand.

=== Which skills were demonstrated

The skills demonstrated were:

Analysing the graphic according to  Markel & Selber's six characteristics of good technical communication (Markel & Selber, 2021):

* Addresses particular readers

* Helps readers solve problems

* Is produced collaboratively
* Reflects an organizationâ€™s goals and culture
* Uses design to increase readability, and

* Consists of words or graphics or both.

The improvements included:

* Improving the English to first language speaker standard. Separating the languages (English and Chinese were mixed in the original brochure). Chinese was not included in the redesigned brochure.

* Restructuring the information in a logical flow and in distinct sections.

* Adding information in compliance with safety standards i.e., including the necessary warnings and cautions.

* Adding troubleshooting help and contact information.

* Finding and adding missing information and graphics.

* Creating a more visually appealing layout.

* Adding a table of contents and an index.

* Adding a glossary

* Adding instructions for care of the product

* Adding a QR code for easy access to the One is All website

=== What I learnt from improving the instructions brochure

* How to systematically analyse the content against Markel and Selber's six criteria.

* How to target a particular audience (English speakers) and tailor the content to them.

* To provide help and support possibilities so that consumers can solve problems with the product themselves.

* To improve the readability of the brochure, including graphics, admonitions, and text to enhance the user's understanding.

* To pay attention to detail, and use clear and concise language.

* To make the information easy to find and understand.
