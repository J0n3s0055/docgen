  ### Component's Latest Version
  #
  # We want to know the latest version of each component so we can create a redirect for the latest version.
  # Such a redirect would be useful for users that want to bookmark a link to the latest documentation for a component.
  # For example, we would be able to provide a link of the form: https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest.
  # It is also nice to be able to indicate a component's version in the main navigation panel (modules/ROOT/nav.adoc).
  #
  # However, we do not currently have any other way to determine the latest version of a component outside a page in the component itself.
  # So, as a workaround, we store the latest version of each component in these site-wide asciidoc attributes.
  # The downside is that we have to update these attributes whenever we release a new version of a component.
  #
  #eforms_latest_version: '1.10.0'
  #epo_latest_version: '4.0.0'
  #espd_latest_version: '3.3.0'
